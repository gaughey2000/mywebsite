## üåê Part 1: Sign Up & Connect GitHub (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Netlify Account

1. Go to **https://app.netlify.com/signup**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Part 2: Configure Build Settings (3 minutes)

You'll see a configuration screen with 3 sections:

### Section 1: Site Settings
- **Site name**: Leave default (you can change it later)
- **Branch to deploy**: `main` ‚úÖ (already selected)

### Section 2: Build Settings

This is **CRITICAL** - configure exactly like this:

```
Base directory:     client
Build command:      npm install && npm run build
Publish directory:  client/dist
Functions directory: (leave empty)
```

**Important**: Make sure "Base directory" is set to `client`, not blank!

- Old A or CNAME records pointing to Namecheap servers

**How to delete**: Click the trash icon üóëÔ∏è next to each record

Host:  @
Value: 75.2.60.5

```

#### Record 2: WWW Subdomain (CNAME)
```

## üîí Part 7: Enable HTTPS (Automatic)

Back in Netlify:

1. Go to **"Domain settings"** ‚Üí **"HTTPS"**
2. Netlify will automatically provision an SSL certificate
3. This happens automatically once DNS is configured
4. Status will show:
   - ‚è≥ "Waiting for DNS propagation" (10-30 min)
   - ‚è≥ "Provisioning certificate" (1-5 min)
   - ‚úÖ "Certificate active" (Done!)

### Force HTTPS Redirect

Once certificate is active:

1. Scroll down to **"Force HTTPS"**
2. Toggle it **ON** (slider turns blue)
3. This redirects `http://` to `https://` automatically

---

## ‚úÖ Part 8: Verify Everything Works

### Test These URLs:

1. **http://connor-mcgaughey.co.uk**
   - Should redirect to https:// ‚úÖ
   
2. **https://connor-mcgaughey.co.uk**
   - Should show your site with green padlock üîí ‚úÖ
   
3. **https://www.connor-mcgaughey.co.uk**
   - Should also work ‚úÖ
   
4. **Your old Netlify URL** (wonderful-name-123456.netlify.app)
   - Still works as a backup ‚úÖ

### Test Site Functionality:

- [ ] All pages load (Home, Projects, About, Contact)
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Theme switcher works
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Images load (favicon, etc)
- [ ] Fast load time

---

## üéØ What About the Contact Form?

**Current status**: Form displays but won't send emails yet

**Why**: Backend API not deployed yet

**Next step**: Deploy backend to Railway (see `RAILWAY-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`)

**For now**: The form shows your email as fallback, so visitors can still contact you!

---

## üîÑ Part 9: Set Up Auto-Deploy

**Good news**: This is already configured! üéâ

Every time you push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update: your changes"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically:
1. Detect the push
2. Build your site
3. Deploy the update
4. Live in 2-3 minutes!

### View Build Status:

1. Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí **"Deploys"** tab
2. See all past and current deployments
3. Click any deploy to see logs

---

## üé® Part 10: Optional Site Settings

### Change Site Name:

1. Site settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Site details
2. Click **"Change site name"**
3. Pick something memorable (e.g., `connor-portfolio`)
4. Your Netlify URL becomes: `connor-portfolio.netlify.app`

### Deploy Notifications:

1. Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Deploy notifications
2. Add email or Slack notifications for:
   - Deploy succeeded

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Site Not Found" After Adding Domain

**Cause**: DNS hasn't propagated yet
**Solution**: Wait 30 minutes, clear browser cache, try again

**Check DNS**: 
```bash
# Mac/Linux terminal
dig connor-mcgaughey.co.uk

# Should show: 75.2.60.5
```

### "Certificate Provisioning Failed"

**Cause**: DNS not configured correctly
**Solution**: 
1. Verify DNS records in Namecheap
2. Wait for DNS to propagate
3. In Netlify: Domain settings ‚Üí "Verify DNS configuration"

### Build Fails After Code Changes

1. Check **Netlify deploy log** for exact error
2. Test build locally: `cd client && npm run build`
3. Fix the error
4. Push to GitHub
5. Netlify will auto-retry

### Old Netlify URL Shows Old Content

**Cause**: Browser cache
**Solution**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
